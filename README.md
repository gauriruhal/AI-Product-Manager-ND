# AI-Product-Manager-ND
This repository contains work that I did as part of AI Product Manager Nano degree program on Udacity.


# Projects implemented are as follows:
# 1. Data Annotation
Our goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that

* Can help flag serious cases
* Quickly identify healthy cases
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test our ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product.

# 2. Training an ML model using Google Auto ML
Build a Model with Google AutoML to classify images as having pneumonia symptoms or healthy.

# 3. Capstone
Developed a business proposal for an AI product called "Automatic License Plate Recognition".
