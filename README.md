# AI-Product-Manager-ND
This repository contains work that I did as part of AI Product Manager Nano degree program on Udacity.


# Projects implemented are as follows:
# 1. Data Annotation
Our goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that

* Can help flag serious cases
* Quickly identify healthy cases
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test our ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product.

# 2. Training an ML model using Google Auto ML
In this project, we need to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images.This dataset would eventually be used to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children.we are going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product.For this task,we will use Google AutoML,an automated machine learning tool that will allow us to build the model and host it in the cloud. In order to appreciate how training data impact models,we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset.The goals of this product are

* Help flag serious cases,
* Quickly identify healthy cases,
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors.
## The Four Parts of the Project
We will train four different models using four variants of the pneumonia dataset.The dataset contains childrens' chest x-ray images, and that they are classified into two classes, "normal" and "pneumonia". The following cases describe the steps we must take to create each model.

### Case 1: Create a binary classifier to detect pneumonia using chest x-rays
### Case 2: Create an unbalanced binary classifier
### Case 3: Create a binary classifier with dirty data
### Case 4: Create a three-class model with the classes “normal”, “bacterial pneumonia”, and “viral pneumonia”

# 3. Capstone
Developed a business proposal for an AI product called "Automatic License Plate Recognition".
